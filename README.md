# 📁 Guessit - A Fun File Counting Game

Welcome to **Guessit**, a simple and fun Bash game created by Spandana!  
The goal is to guess how many files are in the **current directory**.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- The script will prompt you to **guess the number of files** in the directory.
- If your guess is incorrect, it will tell you whether it's **too high** or **too low**.
- You'll keep guessing until you get the **exact number**.
- When you guess correctly, it will congratulate you and display the list of files!
